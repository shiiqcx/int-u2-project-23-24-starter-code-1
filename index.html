  <p> Color can add lots of feeling to your artwork. Using color contrast, you can add a climax or maybe even some
    drama to your workpiece. An example is shown in the image above, where the artist uses colors such as blue in the
    background to portray sadness and various colors, such as green. pink, and even yellow, to convey a sense of
    confusion in the mind.</p>

  <p>In what other ways do the colors in the image above contrast with each other to create a feeling?</p>
